## Research
My primary research focus lies in the field of sequence generation tasks, including low-resource machine translation and domain adaptation for machine translation. Currently, my main research objective is to design a training-free and denoising k-nearest neighbor machine translation algorithm framework that aims to achieve exceptional performance while minimizing computational costs.
